direction of Mr Charrington's shop, keeping one eye open for the patrols, but irrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone interfering with him.", "The heavy brief-case that he was carrying bumped against his knee at each step, sending a tingling sensation up and down the skin of his leg.", "Inside it was the book, which he had now had in his possession for six days

the films, the waxworks, the rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets, the tramp of marching feet, the grinding of the caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes, the booming of guns — after six days of this, when the great orgasm was quivering to its climax and the general hatred of Eurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if the crowd could have got their hands on the 2,000 Eurasian war-criminals who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the proceedings, they would unquestionably have torn them to pieces — at just this moment it had been announced that Oceania

London squares at the moment when it happened.", "It was night, and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly floodlit.", "The square was packed with several thousand people, including a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the Spies.", "On a scarlet-draped platform an orator of the Inner Party, a small lean man with disproportionately long arms and a large bald skull over which a few lank locks straggled, was haranguing the crowd.", "A little Rumpelstiltskin figure, contorted with hatred, he gripped the neck of the microphone with one hand while the other, enormous at the end of a bony arm, clawed the air menacingly above his head.", "His voice, made metallic by the amplifiers, boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities, massacres, deportations, lootings, rapings, torture of prisoners, bombing of civilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, broken treaties.", "It was almost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and then maddened.", "At every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that rose uncontrollably from thousands of throats.", "The most savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren.", "The speech had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paper was slipped into the speaker's hand.", "He unrolled and read it without pausing in his speech.", "Nothing altered in his voice or manner, or in the content of what he was saying, but suddenly the names were different.", "Without words said, a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd.", "Oceania was at war with Eastasia!", "The next moment there was a tremendous commotion.", "The banners and posters with which the square was decorated were all wrong!", "Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them.", "It was sabotage!", "The agents of Goldstein had been at work!", "There was a riotous interlude while posters were ripped from the walls, banners torn to shreds and trampled underfoot.", "The Spies performed prodigies of activity in clambering over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that fluttered from the chimneys.", "But within two or three minutes it was all over.", "The orator, still gripping the neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward, his free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with his speech.", "One minute more, and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the crowd.", "The Hate continued exactly as before, except that the target had been changed."], "p": 791}, {"t": "text", "c": ["The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was that the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence, not only without a pause, but without even breaking the syntax.", "But at the moment he had other things to preoccupy him.", "It was during the moment of disorder while the posters were being torn down that a man whose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulder and said, 'Excuse me, I think you've dropped your brief-case.'", "He took the brief-case abstractedly, without speaking.", "He knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity to look inside it.", "The instant that the demonstration was over he went straight to the Ministry of Truth, though the time was now nearly

more so because the processes that it involved could not be called by their true names.", "Everyone in the Records Department worked eighteen hours in the twenty-four, with two three-hour snatches of sleep.", "Mattresses were brought up from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors: meals consisted of sandwiches and Victory Coffee wheeled round on trolleys by attendants from the canteen.",

of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift, half burying the speakwrite and overflowing on to the floor, so that the first job was always to stack them into a neat enough pile to give him room to work.", "What was worst of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical.", "Often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another, but any detailed report of events

of his ink-pencil, was a deliberate lie.", "He was as anxious as anyone else in the Department that the forgery should be perfect.", "On the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders slowed down.", "For as much as half an hour nothing came out of the tube; then one more cylinder, then nothing.", "Everywhere at about the same time the work was easing off.", "A deep and as it were secret
